			<h3> Guru Nanak Dev Ji</h3>
			<p class="">Guru from 1469 to 1539 The first of the Gurus and the founder of the Sikh religion was Guru Nanak. He was born at Talwandi
			(now known as Nankana Sahib in Pakistan) on October 20, 1469. Guru ji mastered Punjabi, Sanskrit and Persian at an early
			age and in childhood revolted against ritualism, caste, prejudices, hypocrisy and idolatry. He regarded Hindus and Muslims
			as equals and referred to himself as neither Hindu nor Muslim but as a brother to all those who believed in God and truth.
			He made four great journeys, travelling to all parts of India, and into Arabia and Persia; visiting Mecca and Baghdad. He
			spoke before Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Parsees, and Muslims. He spoke in the temples and mosques, and at various pilgrimage
			sites. Wherever he went, Guru Nanak spoke out against empty religious rituals, pilgrimages, the caste system, the sacrifice
			of widows, of depending on books to learn the true religion, and of all the other tenets that were to define his teachings.
			Never did he ask his listeners to follow him. He asked the Muslims to be true Muslims and the Hindus to be true Hindus.</p>

			<h3> Guru Granth Sahib Ji</h3>
			<p class="">He was born in 1504. Guru Angad invented and introduced the Gurmukhi (written form of Punjabi) script and made it known to
			all Sikhs. The scripture of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji is written in Gurmukhi. This scripture is also the basis of the Punjabi
			language. It became the script of the masses very soon. Guru Angad was a model of self-less service to his Sikhs and showed
			them the way to devotional prayers. He took great interest in the education of the children by opening many schools for their
			instruction and thus greatly increased literacy. For the youth he started the tradition of Mall Akhara, where physical as
			well as spiritual exercises were held. He collected the facts about Guru Nanak Sahib's life from Bhai Bala ji and wrote the
			first biography of Guru Nanak Sahib. (The Bhai Bale Wali Janamsakhi currently available is not the same as that which Guru
			Angad Sahib compiled.) He also wrote 63 Saloks (stanzas), these were included in Guru Granth Sahib. He popularized and expanded
			the institution of 'Guru ka Langar' started by Guru Nanak Sahib earlier.

			<h3> Guru Amardas Das Sahib Ji</h3>
			<p class="">He was born in 1479. Guru Amardas took up cudgels of spirituality to fight against caste restrictions, caste prejudices and
			the curse of untouchability. He strengthened the tradition of the free kitchen, Guru Ka Langar (started by Guru Nanak), and
			made his disciples, whether rich or poor, whether high born or low born (according to the Hindu caste system), have their
			meals together sitting in one place. He thus established social equality amongst the people. Guru Amardas introduced the
			Anand Karaj marriage ceremony for the Sikhs, replacing the Hindu form. He also completely abolished amongst the Sikhs, the
			custom of Sati, in which a married woman was forced to burn herself to death in the funeral pyre of her husband. The custom
			of Paradah (Purda), in which a woman was required to cover her face with a veil, was also done away with.

			<h3>Guru Ram Das Sahib Ji</h3>
			<p class="">He was born in 1534. Guru ji founded the city of Amritsar and started the construction of the famous Golden Temple at Amritsar,
			the holy city of the Sikhs. He requested the, Muslim Sufi, Mian Mir to lay the cornerstone of the Harmandir Sahib. The temple
			remains open on all sides and at all times to everyone. This indicates that the Sikhs believe in One God who has no partiality
			for any particular place, direction or time. The standard Sikh marriage ceremony known as the Anand Karaj is centered around
			the Lawan, a four stanza hymn composed by Guru Ram Das ji. The marriage couple circumscribe the Guru Granth Sahib ji as each
			stanza is read. The first round is the Divine consent for commencing the householders life through marriage. The second round
			states that the union of the couple has been brought about by God. In the third round the couple is described as the most
			fortunate as they have sung the praises of the Lord in the company of saints. In the fourth round the feeling of the couple
			that they have obtained their hearts desire and are being congratulated is described.

			<h3>Guru Arjan Dev Ji</h3>
			<p class="">He was born in 1563. He was the third son of Guru Ram Das ji. Guru Arjan was a saint and scholar of the highest quality and
			repute. He compiled the Adi Granth, the scriptures of the Sikhs, and wrote the Sukhmani Sahib. To make it a universal teaching,
			Guru ji included in it hymns of Muslim saints as well those of low-caste pariah saints who were never permitted to enter
			various temples. Guru Arjan Dev completed construction of Sri Darbar Sahib also known as Golden Temple in Amritsar. Sri Darbar
			Sahib welcomes all without discrimination, which is symbolised by the four doors that are open in four directions. Guru ji
			became the first great martyr in Sikh history when Emperor Jahangir ordered his execution.

			<h3>Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji</h3>
			<p class="">He was born in 1595. He was the son of Guru Arjan Dev and was known as a "soldier saint," Guru Hargobind ji organised a small
			army, explaining that extreme non-violence and pacifism would only encourage evil and so the principles of Miri-Piri were
			established. Guru ji taught that it was necessary to take up the sword in order to protect the weak and the oppressed. Guru
			ji was first of the Gurus to take up arms to defend the faith. At that time it was only emperors who were allowed to sit
			on a raised platform, called a takhat or throne. At the age of 13, Guru Hargobind erected Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, ten feet
			above the ground and adorned two swords, Miri and Piri, representing temporal and spiritual power.
